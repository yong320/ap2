"""Agent executor for processing payments on behalf of a merchant.

This agent's role is to:
1. Complete payments, engaging with the credentials provider agent when needed.

In order to clearly demonstrate the use of the Agent Payments Protocol A2A
extension, this agent was built directly using the A2A framework.

The core logic of how an A2A agent processes requests and generates responses is
handled by an AgentExecutor. The BaseServerExecutor handles the common task of
interpreting the user's request, identifying the appropriate tool to use, and
invoking it to complete a task.
